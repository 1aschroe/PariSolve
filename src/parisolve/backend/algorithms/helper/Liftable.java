/**
 * structure which helps to efficiently iterate over vertices, which tries to
 * suggest a vertex as few times as possible. It does that by suggesting a
 * vertex's predecessors, if the vertex itself could be used.
 * 
 * One application of this class is the iteration of liftable vertices in
 * <code>SmallMeasureAlgorithm</code>. This is done on the basis of the idea
 * expressed in LNCS 2500 p. 123 to implement a queue which hold the liftable
 * vertices. The idea for this structures implementation bases on the fact that
 * a lift is recalculating the prog-values of vertices, which change iff the
 * successors value changes. Therefore, once a vertex has been lifted, its
 * predecessors are checked, whether these can also be lifted.
 * 
 * Another application is that of finding vertices which might belong to a
 * attractor as used in <code>RecursiveAlgorithm.getAttractor()</code>.
 * 
 * As it implements the <code>Iterable</code> interface, one can use instances
 * of this class in for-each-loops. If a vertex could be used and the
 * predecessors of this vertex should be iterated as well, the method
 * <code>liftWasSuccessful()</code> has to be called with this vertex.
 * 
 * Instances can be obtained from a <code>LiftableFactory</code> which for
 * performance reasons stores the predecessor-structure to eliminate the need to
 * recalculate it.
